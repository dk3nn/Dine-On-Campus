    <h2> New York Pizza </h2>
        <h21> About </h21>
        <p> New York Pizza is a popular pizzaria located on Tate street right next to campus.
            Serving delicious pizza, subs, pasta dishes and more, New York Pizza is a great, reliable place to grab a meal at any time of day
            or night. Since my freshman year, I've been enjoying their food and one of the best restraunts within walking distance of campus.
