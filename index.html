        <h5> About </h5>
        <p> New York Pizza is a popular pizzaria located on Tate street right next to campus.
            Serving delicious pizza, subs, pasta dishes and more, New York Pizza is a great, reliable place to grab a meal at any time of day
            or night. Since my freshman year, I've been enjoying their food and one of the best restraunts within walking distance of campus.

        <p> Though I usually get Pizza, the Chicken Parmesan is one of my favorite dishes at New York Pizza and is worth the try!
